deceased victim not suffered the fatal injury, less expenses of the
dependent avoided by reason of death of the victim and not
subtracted in calculating the economic loss of the dependent;

by the victim or by income the victim would have earned in available
appropriate substitute work that the victim was capable of
performing but unreasonably failed to undertake, or loss of income
from work the victim’s caregiver would have performed if the
injuries of the victim sustained as a result of the criminally
injurious conduct had not created the need for the caregiver to miss
work to care for the injured victim; and
  14. "Victim" means a person who suffers personal injury or
death as a result of criminally injurious conduct and shall include
a resident of this state who is injured or killed by an act of

compensation on any medical or mental health treatment, and require
that providers of medical or mental health treatment be licensed
prior to compensating for said treatment. Awards for all medical
services shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the total cost of
the service less any other reduction for contributory conduct, as
determined by the Board. Any medical provider that receives payment
from the Crime Victims Compensation Revolving Fund for medical,
dental or psychological services, or any provider that supplies
equipment pursuant to an award under the Oklahoma Crime Victims
Compensation Act shall, as a condition of the receipt of such
payment, accept such payment as discharging in full any and all
obligations of the claimant to pay, reimburse or compensate the
provider for medical services, supplies or equipment that have been
reimbursed pursuant to the Oklahoma Crime Victims Compensation Act. 
In the event the claimant has paid for a medical service, the
claimant will be reimbursed for the out-of-pocket loss, less any
reductions for contributory conduct, as determined by the Board.
  G. All records and information given to the Board to process a
claim on behalf of a crime victim shall be confidential. Such
exhibits, medical records, psychological records, counseling
records, work records, criminal investigation records, criminal
court case records, witness statements, telephone records, and other
records of any type or nature whatsoever gathered for the purpose of


evaluating whether to compensate a victim shall not be obtainable by
any party to any civil or criminal action through any discovery
process except:
  1. In the event of an appeal under the Administrative
Procedures Act from a decision of the Board and then only to the
extent narrowly and necessarily to obtain court review; or
  2. Upon a strict showing to the court in a separate civil or
criminal action that particular information or documents are not
obtainable after diligent effort from any independent source, and
are known to exist otherwise only in Board records, the court may
inspect in camera such records to determine whether the specific
requested information exists. If the court determines the specific
information sought exists in the Board's records, the documents may
then be released only by court order if the court finds as part of
its order that the documents will not pose any threat to the safety
of the victim or any other person whose identity may appear in the
Board's records.
  H. When a person files a claim, all providers that have been
given notice of a pending claim shall refrain from all debt
collection activities relating to medical treatment or other
services received by the person in connection with such claim until
an award is made on the claim or until a claim is determined to be
noncompensable pursuant to the provisions of this act. The statute
of limitations for collection of such debt shall be tolled during
the period in which the applicable health care provider or other
service provider is required to refrain from debt collection
activities under this subsection. For the purposes of this
subsection, "debt collection activities" means repeatedly calling or
writing to the claimant and threatening either to turn the matter
over to a debt collection agency or to an attorney for collection,
enforcement, or filing of other process. The term shall not include
routine billing about the status of the claim.

§21-142.10. Award of compensation - Criteria - Amount - Denial,
withdrawal or reduction - Reconsideration.
  A. Compensation shall not be awarded:
  1. Unless the claim has been filed with the Crime Victims
Compensation Board within thirty (30) months after the injury or
death upon which the claim is based. If the victim is under a
mental or cognitive disability or is a child under eighteen (18)
years of age, the Board may use the date the criminal incident was
disclosed to a responsible adult when establishing whether or not
the claim was timely filed. In cases involving sexual assault of an


adult eighteen (18) years of age or older, the Board may use the
date the sexual assault forensic evidence kit was tested when
establishing whether the claim was timely filed. The Board may, at
its discretion, extend the filing period beyond one (1) year upon a
showing of good cause or in all cases of sexual assault;
  2. To a claimant who was the offender, or an accomplice of the
offender;
  3. To another person if the award would unjustly benefit the
offender or accomplice; or
  4. Unless after the criminally injurious conduct resulting in
injury or death:
     a. such conduct was reported to a law enforcement officer
        within seventy-two (72) hours after its occurrence,
     b. in the case of sexual assault, the victim undergoes a
        forensic medical examination within one hundred twenty
        (120) hours after its occurrence, or
     c. the Board finds there was good cause for the failure
        to report the crime or obtain a forensic medical
        examination within the time specified in subparagraph
        a or b of this paragraph.
  B. Compensation otherwise payable to a claimant shall be
diminished to the extent:
  1. That the economic loss is recouped from collateral sources;
or
  2. Of the degree of responsibility for the cause of the injury
or death attributable to the victim as determined by the Board. 
Provided, a self-inflicted injury shall not be attributable to the
victim when the Board finds the injury is a direct result of the
crime committed against the victim.
  C. The Board, upon finding that the claimant or victim has not
fully cooperated with appropriate law enforcement agencies, may
deny, withdraw or reduce an award of compensation. Victims of
sexual assault who undergo a forensic medical examination within one
hundred twenty (120) hours after the sexual assault shall be found
to have fully cooperated. The Board may extend this period of time
for good cause.
  D. The Board, on its own motion or on request of the claimant,
may reconsider a decision granting or denying an award or
determining its amount. The motion or request to reconsider a
decision shall be made within six (6) months from the date of the
last action by the Board on the claim at issue. An order on
reconsideration of an award shall not require a refund of amounts
previously paid unless the award was obtained by fraud. The right

  B. Compensation payable to a victim and to all other claimants
sustaining economic loss because of injury to or death of that
victim may not exceed Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) in
the aggregate. The Board may, after approval of an initial award of
Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00), grant an additional sum
not to exceed Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00),
specifically for loss of wages for the victim or loss of support for
dependents of a deceased victim, provided there is verifiable
economic loss after deducting payments from other sources. In no
event shall compensation payable to a victim and to all other
claimants sustaining economic loss because of injury to or death of
that victim exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) in the
aggregate.
  C. The Board may provide for the payment to a claimant in a
lump sum or in installments. At the request of the claimant, the
Board may convert future economic loss, other than allowable
expense, to a lump sum.
  D. An award payable in a lump sum or installments for loss of
support for a dependent of the deceased victim may be computed
through a formula which calculates the net loss of support for
dependents based upon an estimated date of retirement or an
estimated date of adulthood for dependent children, beginning with
the date of death of the victim and ending with the least of one of
the following time periods for each dependent filing loss of
support:
  1. The amount of time from the date of death of the victim to
the date the victim would have been expected to reach sixty-two (62)
years of age;
  2. The amount of time from the date of death of the victim to
the date the spouse of the victim is expected to reach sixty-two
(62) years of age; or
  3. The amount of time from the date of death of the victim to
the date a dependent child is expected to reach eighteen (18) years
of age or twenty-three (23) years of age if the dependent child is
enrolled as a full-time student. An award payable in installments
for future loss of support may be modified by the Board in the event
a dependent child receiving loss of support is between the ages of
eighteen (18) and twenty-three (23) years of age and is no longer
enrolled as a full-time student, the dependent dies before all


installments are paid or the dependent receiving installments moves
and leaves no forwarding address with the Board office.
  E. An award shall not be subject to execution, attachment,
garnishment or other process, except for child support and except
that an award for allowable expense shall not be exempt from a claim
of a creditor to the extent that such creditor has provided
products, services or accommodations, the costs of which are
included in the award.
  F. An assignment by the claimant to any future award under the
provisions of Section 142.1 et seq. of this title is unenforceable,
except:
  1. An assignment of any award for work loss to assure payment
of court ordered alimony, maintenance or child support; or
  2. An assignment of any award for allowable expense to the
extent that the benefits are for the cost of products, services or
accommodations necessitated by the injury or death on which the
claim is based and are provided or to be provided by the assignee.
  G. The Board may, in its discretion, approve payment of crisis
counseling, occurring within three (3) years of the crime, in an
amount not to exceed Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) for each
family member of a homicide victim; provided, the counselor is a
qualified mental health care provider. Medical and pharmaceutical
treatment is not compensable for any family member of a deceased
victim.
  H. Outpatient counseling expenses for a victim of criminally
injurious conduct may be considered by the Board provided the
counseling is focused on the crime and the counselor is a qualified
mental health care provider. A total not to exceed Three Thousand
Dollars ($3,000.00) may be awarded for individual counseling
sessions for victims of criminally injurious conduct. Sessions
between the mental health care provider and nonoffending parents of
a victimized child under eighteen (18) years of age may also be
included in the award provided the combined total for the counseling
and parental sessions does not exceed Three Thousand Dollars
($3,000.00) and the parental sessions relate to the victimization. 
In extreme cases, the Board may, in its discretion, waive the threethousand-dollar limit. Inpatient mental health treatment will be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may be compensated, at the
discretion of the Board, in an amount not to exceed Twenty Thousand
Dollars ($20,000.00).

justice hearing, the court shall inquire into the circumstances
requiring the delay and consider the interests of the victim of a

  1. it is clear from the identity of the offender and the
character of his acts that disruptive conduct is willfully
contemptuous; or
  2. the conduct warranting the sanction is preceded by a clear
warning that the conduct is impermissible and that specified

The remedies provided by this section are available regardless of

§ 12, eff. Nov. 1, 2008.
§21-566.1. Noncompliance with child support order - Indirect civil
contempt.
  A. When a court of competent jurisdiction has entered an order
compelling a parent to furnish child support, necessary food,
clothing, shelter, medical support, payment of child care expenses,
or other remedial care for the minor child of the parent:
  1. Proof that:
     a. the order was made, filed, and served on the parent,
     b. the parent had actual knowledge of the existence of
        the order,
     c. the order was granted by default after prior due
        process notice to the parent, or
     d. the parent was present in court at the time the order
        was pronounced; and
  2. Proof of noncompliance with the order,


shall be prima facie evidence of an indirect civil contempt of
court.
  B. 1. In the case of indirect contempt for the failure to
comply with an order for child support, child support arrears, or
other support, punishment shall be, at the discretion of the court:
     a. incarceration in the county jail not exceeding six (6)
        months, or
     b. incarceration in the county jail on weekends or at
        other times that allow the obligor to be employed,
        seek employment or engage in other activities ordered
        by the court.
  2. Punishment may also include imposition of a fine in a sum
not exceeding Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00).
  3. In the case of indirect contempt for the failure to comply
with an order for child support, child support arrears, or other
support, if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that
the obligor is willfully unemployed, the court may require the
obligor to work two (2) eight-hour days per week in a community
service program as defined in Section 339.7 of Title 19 of the
Oklahoma Statutes, if the county commissioners of that county have
implemented a community service program.
  C. 1. During proceedings for indirect contempt of court, the
court may order the obligor to complete an alternative program and
comply with a payment plan for child support and arrears. If the
obligor fails to complete the alternative program and comply with
the payment plan, the court shall proceed with the indirect contempt
and shall impose punishment pursuant to subsection B of this
section.
  2. An alternative program may include:
     a. a problem-solving court program for obligors when
        child support services under the state child support
        plan as provided in Section 237 of Title 56 of the
        Oklahoma Statutes are being provided for the benefit
        of the child. A problem-solving court program is an
        immediate and highly structured judicial intervention
        process for the obligor and requires completion of a
        participation agreement by the obligor and monitoring
        by the court. A problem-solving court program differs
        in practice and design from the traditional
        adversarial contempt prosecution and trial systems. 
        The problem-solving court program uses a team approach
        administered by the judge in cooperation with a child
        support state's attorney and a child support court
        liaison who focuses on removing the obstacles causing
        the nonpayment of the obligor. The obligors in this
        program shall be required to sign an agreement to
        participate in this program as a condition of the


        Department of Human Services agreement to stay
        contempt proceedings or in lieu of incarceration after
        a finding of guilt. The court liaisons assess the
        needs of the obligor, develop a community referral
        network, make referrals, monitor the compliance of the
        obligor in the program, and provide status reports to
        the court, and
     b. participation in programs such as counseling,
        treatment, educational training, social skills
        training or employment training to which the obligor
        reports daily or on a regular basis at specified times
        for a specified length of time.
  D. In the case of indirect contempt for the failure to comply
with an order for child support, child support arrears, or other
support, the Supreme Court shall promulgate guidelines for
determination of the sentence and purge fee. If the court fails to
follow the guidelines, the court shall make a specific finding
stating the reasons why the imposition of the guidelines would
result in inequity. The factors that shall be used in determining
the sentence and purge fee are:
  1. The proportion of the child support, child support arrearage
payments, or other support that was unpaid in relation to the amount
of support that was ordered paid;
  2. The proportion of the child support, child support arrearage
payments, or other support that could have been paid by the party
found in contempt in relation to the amount of support that was
ordered paid;
  3. The present capacity of the party found in contempt to pay
any arrearages;
  4. Any willful actions taken by the party found in contempt to
reduce the capacity of that party to pay any arrearages;
  5. The past history of compliance or noncompliance with the
support order; and
  6. Willful acts to avoid the jurisdiction of the court.

§21-567. Indirect contempts - Proceedings.
  A. In all cases of indirect contempt the party charged with
contempt shall be notified in writing of the accusation and have a
reasonable time for defense; and the party so charged shall, upon
demand, have a trial by jury.
  B. In the event the party so charged shall demand a trial by
jury, the court shall thereupon set the case for trial at the next
jury term of said court, unless such time is waived by the party so
charged, in which event the case shall be set for trial at a time
determined by the court. The court shall fix the amount of an


appearance bond to be posted by said party charged, which bond shall
be signed by said party and two sureties, which sureties together
shall qualify by showing ownership of real property, the equal of
which property shall be in double the amount of the bond, or, in the
alternative, the party charged may deposit with the court clerk cash
equal to the amount of the appearance bond.
  C. In a case of indirect contempt, it shall not be necessary
for the party alleging indirect contempt, or an attorney for that
party, to attend an initial appearance or arraignment hearing for
the party charged with contempt, unless the party alleging the
indirect contempt is seeking a cash bond. If a cash bond is not
being requested, the clerk of the court shall, upon request, notify
the party alleging the indirect contempt of the date of the trial.

custody of the child, shall be guilty of a felony. The fine for a
violation of this subsection shall not exceed Five Thousand Dollars

offender reasonably believes that the act was necessary to preserve
the child from physical, mental, or emotional danger to the child’s
welfare and the offender notifies the local law enforcement agency
nearest to the location where the custodian of the child resides.
  C. If a child is removed from the custody of the child’s lawful
custodian pursuant to the provisions of this section any law
enforcement officer may take the child into custody without a court
order and, unless there is a specific court order directing a law
enforcement officer to take the child into custody and release or
return the child to a lawful custodian, the child shall be held in
emergency or protective custody pursuant to the provisions of

        assure the attendance and compliance of the defendant
        with the provisions of this subsection and the
        domestic abuse counseling or treatment requirements. 
        The court may suspend sentencing of the defendant
        until the defendant has presented proof to the court
        of enrollment in a program of treatment for domestic
        abuse by an individual licensed practitioner or a

        twenty (120) days after the defendant is ordered to
        such counseling or treatment. At such time, the court
        may complete sentencing, beginning the period of the
        sentence from the date that proof of enrollment is
        presented to the court, and schedule reviews as
        required by subparagraphs a and b of this paragraph

        attorney to seek acceleration or revocation of any
        probation entered by the court.

        completion of the counseling or treatment to assure
        the attendance and compliance of the defendant with
        the provisions of this subsection and the domestic
        abuse counseling or treatment requirements. The court
        shall retain continuing jurisdiction over the
        defendant during the course of ordered counseling
        through the final review hearing;
  4. The court may set subsequent or other review hearings as the
court determines necessary to assure the defendant attends and fully
complies with the provisions of this subsection and the domestic
abuse counseling or treatment requirements;
  5. At any review hearing, if the defendant is not

unlawfully and with malice aforethought solicits another person or

  A. Upon conviction or adjudication of guilt of a defendant of
murder in the first degree, wherein the state is not seeking the
death penalty but has alleged that the defendant has prior felony
convictions, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing
proceeding to determine whether the defendant should be sentenced to
life imprisonment without parole or life imprisonment, wherein the
state shall be given the opportunity to prove any prior felony
convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. The proceeding shall be
conducted by the trial judge before the same trial jury as soon as
practicable without presentence investigation.
  B. If the trial jury has been waived by the defendant and the
state, or if the defendant pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, the
sentencing proceeding shall be conducted before the court.

§21-701.10a. Sentencing proceeding on remand - Murder in the first
degree - Admissibility of evidence.
  Notwithstanding subsection A of Section 701.10 of this title,
which requires that the same jury sit in the sentencing phase of a
capital murder trial, the following shall apply:
  1. Upon any appeal by the defendant where the sentence is of
death, the appellate court, if it finds prejudicial error in the
sentencing proceeding only, may set aside the sentence of death and
remand the case to the trial court in the jurisdiction in which the
defendant was originally sentenced. No error in the sentencing
proceeding shall result in the reversal of the conviction for a
capital felony. When a capital case is remanded after vacation of a
death sentence, the prosecutor may:
     a. move the trial court to impose any sentence authorized
        by law at the time of the commission of the crime,
        which the trial court shall impose after a non-jury
        sentencing proceeding, provided, the original
        sentencing proceeding was conducted before the court
        or the original sentencing proceeding was conducted


        before a jury and both the defendant and the state
        waive jury sentencing after remand; or
     b. move the trial court to impanel a new sentencing jury
        who shall determine the sentence of the defendant,
        which may be any sentence authorized by law at the
        time of the commission of the crime, provided, the
        original sentencing proceeding was conducted before a
        jury;
  2. If the prosecutor elects to utilize the procedure provided
in paragraph b of subsection 1 of this section, the trial court
shall impanel a new jury for the purpose of conducting new
sentencing proceedings;
  3. Resentencing proceedings shall be governed by the provisions
of Sections 701.10, 701.11 and 701.12 of this title;
  4. All exhibits and a transcript of all testimony and other
evidence properly admitted in the prior trial and sentencing shall
be admissible in the new sentencing proceeding; additional relevant
evidence may be admitted including testimony of witnesses who
testified at the previous trial;
  5. The provisions of this section are procedural and shall
apply retroactively to any defendant sentenced to death;
  6. This section shall not be construed to amend the provisions
of Section 701.10 of this title, requiring the same jury to sit in
both the guilt and sentencing phases of the original trial.

§21-701.10b. Death sentence prohibited for defendants who were
intellectually disabled prior to age 18 - Sentencing proceedings.
  A. For purposes of this section:
  1. "Intellectual disability" or "intellectually disabled" means
significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, existing
concurrently with significant limitations in adaptive functioning;
  2. "Significant limitations in adaptive functioning" means
significant limitations in two or more of the following adaptive
skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social skills,
community use, self-direction, health, safety, functional academics,
leisure skills and work skills; and
  3. "Significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning"
means an intelligence quotient of seventy (70) or below.
  B. Regardless of any provision of law to the contrary, no
defendant who is intellectually disabled shall be sentenced to
death; provided, however, the onset of the intellectual disability
must have been manifested before the defendant attained the age of
eighteen (18) years.
  C. The defendant has the burden of production and persuasion to
demonstrate intellectual disability by showing significantly


subaverage general intellectual functioning, significant limitations
in adaptive functioning, and that the onset of the intellectual
disability was manifested before the age of eighteen (18) years. An
intelligence quotient of seventy (70) or below on an individually
administered, scientifically recognized standardized intelligence
quotient test administered by a licensed psychiatrist or
psychologist is evidence of significantly subaverage general
intellectual functioning; however, it is not sufficient without
evidence of significant limitations in adaptive functioning and
without evidence of manifestation before the age of eighteen (18)
years. In determining the intelligence quotient, the standard
measurement of error for the test administrated shall be taken into
account.
  However, in no event shall a defendant who has received an
intelligence quotient of seventy-six (76) or above on any
individually administered, scientifically recognized, standardized
intelligence quotient test administered by a licensed psychiatrist
or psychologist, be considered intellectually disabled and, thus,
shall not be subject to any proceedings under this section.
  D. A defendant charged with capital murder who intends to raise
an intellectual disability as a bar to the death sentence shall
provide to the state notice of such intention at least ninety (90)
days after formal arraignment or within ninety (90) days after the
filing of a bill of particulars, whichever is later. The notice
shall include a brief but detailed statement specifying the
witnesses, nature and type of evidence sought to be introduced. The
notice must demonstrate sufficient facts that demonstrate a goodfaith belief as to the intellectual disability of the defendant.
  E. The district court shall conduct an evidentiary hearing to
determine whether the defendant is intellectually disabled. If the
court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that the
defendant is intellectually disabled, the defendant, if convicted,
shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or life without parole. If
the district court determines that the defendant is not
intellectually disabled, the capital trial of the offense may
proceed. A request for a hearing under this section shall not waive
entitlement by the defendant to submit the issue of an intellectual
disability to a jury during the sentencing phase in a capital trial
if convicted of an offense punishable by death. The court's
determination on the issue of an intellectual disability shall not
be the subject of an interlocutory appeal.
  F. The court shall submit a special issue to the jury as to
whether the defendant is intellectually disabled. This special
issue shall be considered and answered by the jury during the
sentencing stage and prior to the determination of sentence. If the
jury unanimously determines that the defendant is intellectually
disabled, the defendant may only be sentenced to life imprisonment


or life without parole. The defendant has the burden of production
and persuasion to demonstrate an intellectual disability to the jury
by a preponderance of the evidence.
  G. If the jury determines that the defendant is not
intellectually disabled or is unable to reach a unanimous decision,
the jury shall proceed to determine the existence of aggravating and
mitigating factors in determining whether the sentence of death
shall be imposed. In those deliberations, the jury may consider any
evidence of an intellectual disability as a mitigating factor in
sentencing the defendant.
  H. If the jury determines that the defendant is not
intellectually disabled and imposes a death sentence, the trial
court shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to
the issue of whether the determination on the issue of an
intellectual disability was made under the influence of passion,
prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The findings shall be
attached as an exhibit to the report of the trial judge required
under Section 701.13 of Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes. If the
trial court finds that the determination of an intellectual
disability was not supported by the evidence, the issue may be
raised on appeal to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals for
consideration as part of its mandatory sentence review.
  I. The standard of review for a trier of fact intellectual
disability determination shall be whether, after reviewing the
evidence in the light most favorable to the state, any rational
trier of fact could have found the defendant not intellectually
disabled as defined by this section, giving full deference to the
findings of the trier of fact.
  J. The court shall give appropriate instructions in those cases
in which evidence of the intellectual disability of the defendant
requires the consideration by the jury of the provisions of this
section.

§21-701.11. Instructions - Jury findings of aggravating
circumstance.
  In the sentencing proceeding, the statutory instructions as
determined by the trial judge to be warranted by the evidence shall
be given in the charge and in writing to the jury for its
deliberation. The jury, if its verdict be a unanimous
recommendation of death, shall designate in writing, signed by the
foreman of the jury, the statutory aggravating circumstance or
circumstances which it unanimously found beyond a reasonable doubt.
In nonjury cases the judge shall make such designation. Unless at
least one of the statutory aggravating circumstances enumerated in
this act is so found or if it is found that any such aggravating


circumstance is outweighed by the finding of one or more mitigating
circumstances, the death penalty shall not be imposed. If the jury
cannot, within a reasonable time, agree as to punishment, the judge
shall dismiss the jury and impose a sentence of imprisonment for
life without parole or imprisonment for life.

the use or threat of violence to the person;
  2. The defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to
more than one person;
  3. The person committed the murder for remuneration or the
promise of remuneration or employed another to commit the murder for
remuneration or the promise of remuneration;
  4. The murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel;
  5. The murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding or
preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution;

commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing
threat to society; or
  8. The victim of the murder was a peace officer as defined by
Section 99 of this title, or correctional employee of an institution
under the control of the Department of Corrections, and such person
was killed while in performance of official duty.

§21-701.13. Death penalty - Review of sentence.
  A. Whenever the death penalty is imposed, and upon the judgment
becoming final in the trial court, the sentence shall be reviewed on
the record by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. The court
reporter of the trial court shall prepare all transcripts necessary
for appeal within six (6) months of the imposition of the sentence.
  The clerk of the trial court, within ten (10) days after
receiving the transcript, shall transmit the entire record and
transcript to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals together with a
notice prepared by the clerk and a report prepared by the trial


judge. The notice shall set forth the title and docket number of
the case, the name of the defendant and the name and address of his
attorney, a narrative statement of the judgment, the offense, and
the punishment prescribed. The report shall be in the form of a
standard questionnaire prepared and supplied by the Oklahoma Court
of Criminal Appeals.
  B. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals shall consider the
punishment as well as any errors enumerated by way of appeal.
  C. With regard to the sentence, the court shall determine:
  1. Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the
influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; and
  2. Whether the evidence supports the jury's or judge's finding
of a statutory aggravating circumstance as enumerated in Section
701.12 of this title.
  D. Both the defendant and the state shall have the right to
submit briefs within the time provided by the court, and to present
oral argument to the court. The defendant shall have one hundred
twenty (120) days from the date of receipt by the court of the
record, transcript notice, and report provided for in subsection A
of this section, in which to submit a brief. The state shall have
sixty (60) days from the date of filing of the defendant's brief to
file a reply brief. The defendant may file a reply brief within a
time period established by the court, however the receipt of the
reply brief, the hearing of oral arguments, and the rendering of a
decision by the court all shall be concluded within one (1) year
after the date of the filing of the reply brief. If the defendant
or the state fails to submit their respective briefs within the
period prescribed by law, the defendant or the state shall transmit
a written statement of explanation to the Presiding Judge of the
Court of Criminal Appeals who shall have the authority to grant an
extension of the time to submit briefs, based upon a showing of just
cause. Failure to submit briefs in the required time may be
punishable as indirect contempt of court.
  E. In addition to its authority regarding correction of errors,
the court, with regard to review of death sentences, shall be
authorized to:
  1. Affirm the sentence of death; or
  2. Set the sentence aside and remand the case for resentencing
by the trial court.
  F. The sentence review shall be in addition to direct appeal,
if taken, and the review and appeal shall be consolidated for
consideration. The court shall render its decision on legal errors
enumerated, the factual substantiation of the verdict, and the
validity of the sentence.
  G. If the court reporter of the trial court fails to complete
preparation of the transcripts necessary for appeal within the sixmonth period required by the provisions of subsection A of this


section, the court reporter shall transmit a written statement of
explanation of such failure to the Chief Justice of the Oklahoma
Supreme Court, the Presiding Judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals,
and the Administrative Director of the Courts. The Court of
Criminal Appeals shall have the authority to grant an extension of
the time for filing the transcripts, based upon a showing of just
cause. Failure to complete the transcripts in the required time may
be punishable as indirect contempt of court and except for just
cause shown may result in revocation of the license of the court
reporter.

institution or other place of confinement used primarily for the
custody of persons convicted of felonies or from custody while in
transit thereto or therefrom unless the officer has reason to know:

        life or to inflict serious bodily harm if not

exploitation. If no such determination is made, the minor shall be
subject to the deprived child provisions of the Oklahoma Children's
Code and made eligible for appropriate child welfare services.

not constitute maiming.
R.L.1910, § 2349.
§21-756. Design to maim inferred.
  A design to injure, disfigure, or disable, is inferred from the
fact of inflicting an injury which is calculated to disfigure or

to the eye, which exposes any person to public hatred, contempt,
ridicule or obloquy, or which tends to deprive him of public
confidence, or to injure him in his occupation, or any malicious

official acts of any and all public officers, except where the
matter stated of and concerning the official act done, or of the
officer, falsely imputes crime to the officer so criticized.
  In all cases of publication of matter not privileged under this
section, malice shall be presumed from the publication; unless the
fact and the testimony rebut the same. No publication which, under
this section, would be privileged, shall be punishable as libel.

§21-774. Defenses in criminal libel action.
  In all criminal prosecutions or indictments for libel, the truth
thereof may be given in evidence to the jury, and if it be made to

for justifiable ends, or was a privileged communication, the
defendant shall be acquitted.
R.L.1910, § 2383.
§21-776. Publication, what constitutes.
  To sustain the charge of publishing libel it is not needful that
the words complained of should have been read by any person; it is

proceedings, malice shall not be implied from publication; but
libelous remarks connected with matter privileged under the last
section, shall not be privileged by reason of their being connected
therewith.
R.L.1910, § 2386.
§21-778. Threatened libel.
  Any person who threatens to publish a libel concerning any other
person, or concerning any relative, wife or child or dead relative
of such person, or member of his family, shall be liable civilly and

time of the robbery.
R.L.1910, § 2367.

§21-796. Taking secretly not robbery.
  The taking of property from the person of another is not
robbery, when it clearly appears that the taking was fully completed

without lawful excuse, to furnish necessary food, clothing, shelter,
monetary child support, medical attendance, payment of court-ordered
day care or payment of court-ordered medical insurance costs for
such child which is imposed by law, upon conviction, is guilty of a
misdemeanor; provided, any person obligated to make child support

imposition of a fine of not more than Five Thousand Dollars

depends upon spiritual means alone through prayer, in accordance
with the tenets and practice of a recognized church or religious
denomination, for the treatment or cure of disease or remedial care
of such child; provided, that medical care shall be provided where


permanent physical damage could result to such child; and that the
laws, rules, and regulations relating to communicable diseases and
sanitary matters are not violated.
  D. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent a court from
immediately assuming custody of a child and ordering whatever action
may be necessary, including medical treatment, to protect the health
or welfare of the child.

prosecution. The Department shall provide assistance to the

Statutes, to provide for the treatment, as such term is defined by
Section 3-403 of Title 43A of the Oklahoma Statutes, of such child. 
Any parent having legal custody of a child who is an alcoholdependent person or a drug-dependent person who without having made
a reasonable effort fails or willfully omits to provide for the
treatment of such child shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. For the
purpose of this subsection, the duty to provide for such treatment
shall mean that the parent having legal custody of a child must
provide for the treatment in such manner and on such occasions as an
ordinarily prudent person, solicitous for the welfare of a child,
would provide.
  I. Venue is proper in prosecutions for violations of this
section in:
  1. Any county where the child resides;
  2. The county in which the court-ordered support was entered or
registered pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Interstate

  A. A person who is the parent, guardian, or person having
custody or control over a child as defined in Section 1-1-105 of
Title 10A of the Oklahoma Statutes, commits child endangerment when
the person:
  1. Knowingly permits physical or sexual abuse of a child;

a controlled dangerous substance is being manufactured or attempted
to be manufactured as defined in Section 2-101 of Title 63 of the

  3. Knowingly permits a child to be present in a vehicle when
the person knows or should have known that the operator of the

  4. Is the driver, operator, or person in physical control of a
vehicle in violation of Section 11-902 of Title 47 of the Oklahoma
Statutes while transporting or having in the vehicle such child or
children.
  However, it is an affirmative defense to this paragraph if the
person had a reasonable apprehension that any action to stop the
physical or sexual abuse or deny permission for the child to be in
the vehicle with an intoxicated person would result in substantial
bodily harm to the person or the child.

person pursuant to the provisions of Section 11-902 or 11-904 of

This subsection shall in no way limit or modify the protections
afforded said child in Section 852 of this title or Section 1-4-904
of Title 10A of the Oklahoma Statutes.
  C. Any person convicted of violating any provision of this
section shall be guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment in
the custody of the Department of Corrections for a term of not more

§21-981. Definitions.
  As used in this act:
  1. A "bet" is a bargain in which the parties agree that,
dependent upon chance, or in which one of the parties to the
transaction has valid reason to believe that it is dependent upon
chance, one stands to win or lose something of value specified in
the agreement. A bet does not include:
     a. bona fide business transactions which are valid under
        the law of contracts including, but not limited to,
        contracts for the purchase or sale at a future date of
        securities or other commodities and agreements to
        compensation for loss caused by the happening of the
        chance including, but not limited to, contracts of
        indemnity or guaranty and life or health and accident
        insurance; or
     b. any charity game conducted pursuant to the provisions
        of the Oklahoma Charity Games Act; or
     c. offers of purses, prizes or premiums to the actual
        participants in public and semipublic events, as
        follows, to wit: Rodeos, animal shows, hunting,
        fishing or shooting competitions, expositions, fairs,
        athletic events, tournaments and other shows and
        contests where the participants qualify for a monetary
        prize or other recognition. This subparagraph further
        excepts an entry fee from the definition of "a bet" as
        applied to enumerated public and semipublic events.
  2. "Consideration" as used in this section means anything which
is a commercial or financial advantage to the promoter or a
disadvantage to any participant. Mere registration without purchase
of goods or services; personal attendance at places or events,
without payment of an admission price or fee; listening to or
watching radio and television programs; answering the telephone or
making a telephone call and acts of like nature are not
consideration. As used in this paragraph, the term "consideration"
shall not include sums of money paid by or for participants in any
bingo game or a game of chance with comparable characteristics as
defined by subparagraph b of paragraph 1 of this section and it
shall be conclusively presumed that such sums paid by or for said
participants were intended by said participants to be for the
benefit of the organizations described in subparagraph b of
paragraph 1 of this section for the use of such organizations in
furthering the purposes of such organizations;


  3. A "gambling device" is a contrivance designed primarily for
gambling purposes which for a consideration affords the player an
opportunity to obtain something of value, the award of which is
determined by chance, or any token, chip, paper, receipt or other
document which evidences, purports to evidence or is designed to
evidence participation in a lottery or the making of a bet. The
fact that the prize is not automatically paid by the device does not
affect its character as a gambling device; and
  4. A "gambling place" is any place, room, building, vehicle,
tent or location which is used for any of the following: making and
settling bets; receiving, holding, recording or forwarding bets or

§21-1040.76. Legislative findings — Legislative intent — Material
or performances harmful to minors — Prohibited acts.
  The Legislature finds that protecting minor children from
overtly sexual and violent content is a legitimate objective that
should be actively enforced.
  The Legislature further finds that the protection of the right
of the people to engage in the freedom of speech and expression is a
sacred right in the United States; however, such performances and
materials may not contain depictions of sexual conduct, nudity, or
inappropriate violence which are harmful to minor children.
  Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that these
provisions be diligently enforced to protect minor children while
also protecting the free speech rights of the public.
  No person, including but not limited to any persons having
custody, control or supervision of any commercial establishment,
shall knowingly:
  1. Display material which is harmful to minors in such a way
that minors, as a part of the invited general public, will be
exposed to view such material. Provided, however, a person shall be
deemed not to have "displayed" material harmful to minors if the
material is kept behind devices commonly known as "blinder racks" so
that the lower two-thirds (2/3) of the material is not exposed to
view;


  2. Sell, furnish, present, distribute, allow to view, or
otherwise disseminate to a minor, with or without consideration, any
material which is harmful to minors; or
  3. Present to a minor or participate in presenting to a minor,
with or without consideration, any performance which is harmful to a
minor.

on a server or other storage device controlled or owned by an
interactive computer service provider as set forth in subsection C

§21-1158a. Court authority to award the right of disposition of
body of decedent.
  The district court for the county where the decedent resided may
award the right of disposition to the person determined by the court
to be the most fit and appropriate to carry out the right of
disposition, and may make decisions regarding the remains of the
decedent if those sharing the right of disposition cannot agree. 
The following provisions shall apply to the determination of the
court under this section:


  1. If the persons holding the right of disposition are two or
more persons with the same relationship to the decedent and cannot,
by majority vote, make a decision regarding the disposition of the
remains of the decedent, any of the persons or a funeral director
with custody of the remains may file a petition asking the district
court to make a determination in the matter;
  2. In making a determination under this section, the district
court shall consider the following:
     a. the reasonableness and practicality of the proposed
        funeral arrangements and disposition,
     b. the degree of the personal relationship between the
        decedent and each person claiming the right of
        disposition,
     c. the desires of the person or persons who are ready,
        willing and able to pay the cost of the funeral
        arrangements and disposition,
     d. the convenience and needs of other families and
        friends wishing to pay respects,

disposition, a funeral director shall not be liable for refusing to
accept the remains or to inter or otherwise dispose of the remains
of the decedent or complete the arrangements for the final
disposition of the remains until the funeral director receives a
court order or other written agreement signed by the parties in the
disagreement that decides the final disposition of the remains. If
the funeral director retains the remains for final disposition while
the parties are in disagreement, the funeral director may embalm,
refrigerate, or shelter the body in order to preserve it while
awaiting the final decision of the district court and may add the
cost of embalming, refrigeration or sheltering to the final
disposition costs. If a funeral director brings an action under
this section, the funeral director may add the legal fees and court
costs associated with a petition under this section to the cost of
final disposition. This section shall not be construed to require
or to impose a duty on a funeral director to bring an action under
this section. A funeral director shall not be held criminally or
civilly liable for choosing not to bring an action under this
section; and
  4. Except to the degree it may be considered by the district
court under subparagraph c of paragraph 2 of this section, the fact
that a person has paid or agreed to pay for all or part of the
funeral arrangements and final disposition does not give that person
a greater right to the right of disposition than the person would


otherwise have. The personal representative of the estate of the
decedent does not, by virtue of being the personal representative,
have a greater claim to the right of disposition than the person
would otherwise have.

authorization form, or any other authorization for disposition shall
be deemed to warrant the truthfulness of any facts set forth
therein, including the identity of the decedent whose remains are to
be buried, cremated, or otherwise disposed of, and the authority of
the person to order such disposition. A funeral establishment shall
have the right to rely on such funeral service contract or
authorization and shall have the authority to carry out the
instructions of the person or persons who the funeral director
reasonably believes holds the right of disposition. The funeral
director shall have no responsibility to contact or to independently
investigate the existence of any next of kin or relative of the
decedent. If there is more than one person in a class who are equal
in priority and the funeral director has no knowledge of any
objection by other members of such class, the funeral director shall
be entitled to rely on and act according to the instructions of the
first person in the class to make funeral and disposition
arrangements; provided that no other person in such class provides
written notice of objections to the funeral director.

firearms within said permitted event area shall be limited to

machete, blackjack, loaded cane, hand chain or metal knuckles from
possession of a firearm, machete, blackjack, loaded cane, hand chain
or metal knuckles in places described in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of

requirements in Section 1290.12 of this title concerning application
for a handgun license shall be waived for active duty peace officers
except as provided in this subsection including, but not limited to,
training, fingerprints and criminal history records checks unless
the officer does not have fingerprints on file or a criminal history
records background check conducted prior to employment as a peace

handgun license. The OSBI shall not be required to conduct any
further investigation into the eligibility of the peace officer
applicant and shall not deny a handgun license except when

letter verifying employment and status as a full-time commissioned
or reserve peace officer;

of any handgun license that is suspended, revoked or voluntarily
returned to CLEET, or that is denied, suspended or revoked by the
OSBI;
  6. CLEET may promulgate any rules, forms or procedures
necessary to implement the provisions of this section; and
  7. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to change or
amend the application process, eligibility, effective date or fees
of any handgun license pending issuance on November 1, 2004, or
previously issued to any peace officer prior to November 1, 2004.

demonstration of competency and qualification to carry and handle a
pistol or exemption from training certificate shall be submitted
with the application for a handgun license. No duplicate, copy,
facsimile or other reproduction of the certificate of training,
certificate of competency and qualification or exemption from
training certificate shall be acceptable as proof of training as
required by the provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act;
  3. The application form shall be completed and delivered by the
applicant, in person, to the sheriff of the county wherein the
applicant resides;
  4. The person shall deliver to the sheriff at the time of
delivery of the completed application form a fee of One Hundred
Dollars ($100.00) for processing the application through the
Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation and processing the required


fingerprints through the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The
processing fee shall be in the form of:
     a. a money order or a cashier's check made payable to the
        Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation,
     b. a nationally recognized credit card issued to the
        applicant. For purposes of this paragraph,
        "nationally recognized credit card" means any
        instrument or device, whether known as a credit card,
        credit plate, charge plate, or by any other name,
        issued with or without fee by the issuer for the use
        of the cardholder in obtaining goods, services, or
        anything else of value on credit which is accepted by
        over one thousand merchants in the state. The
        Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation shall determine
        which nationally recognized credit cards will be
        accepted by the Bureau, or
     c. electronic funds transfer.
Any person paying application fees to the Oklahoma State Bureau of
Investigation by means of a nationally recognized credit card or by
means of an electronic funds transfer shall be required to complete
and submit his or her application through the online application
process of the Bureau.
  The processing fee shall not be refundable in the event of a
denial of a handgun license or any suspension or revocation
subsequent to the issuance of a license. Persons making application
for a firearms instructor shall not be required to pay the
application fee as provided in this section, but shall be required
to pay the costs provided in paragraphs 6 and 8 of this subsection;
  5. The completed application form shall be signed by the
applicant in person before the sheriff. The signature shall be
given voluntarily upon a sworn oath that the person knows the
contents of the application and that the information contained in
the application is true and correct. Any person making any false or
misleading statement on an application for a handgun license shall,
upon conviction, be guilty of perjury as defined by Section 491 of
this title. Any conviction shall be punished as provided in Section
500 of this title. In addition to a criminal conviction, the person
shall be denied the right to have a handgun license pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1290.10 of this title and the Oklahoma State
Bureau of Investigation shall revoke the handgun license, if issued;
  6. Two passport-size photographs of the applicant shall be
submitted with the completed application. The cost of the
photographs shall be the responsibility of the applicant. The
sheriff is authorized to take the photograph of the applicant for
purposes of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act and, if such photographs
are taken by the sheriff, the cost of the photographs shall not
exceed Ten Dollars ($10.00) for the two photos. All money received


by the sheriff from photographing applicants pursuant to the
provisions of this paragraph shall be retained by the sheriff and
deposited into the Sheriff's Service Fee Account;
  7. The sheriff shall witness the signature of the applicant and
review or take the photographs of the applicant and shall verify
that the person making application for a handgun license is the same
person in the photographs submitted and the same person who signed
the application form. Proof of a valid Oklahoma driver license with
a photograph of the applicant or an Oklahoma state photo
identification for the applicant shall be required to be presented
by the applicant to the sheriff for verification of the person's
identity;
  8. Upon verification of the identity of the applicant, the
sheriff shall take two complete sets of fingerprints of the
applicant. Both sets of fingerprints shall be submitted by the
sheriff with the completed application, certificate of training,
certificate of competency and qualification or an exemption from
training certificate, photographs and processing fee to the Oklahoma
State Bureau of Investigation within fourteen (14) days of taking
the fingerprints. The cost of the fingerprints shall be paid by the
applicant. The sheriff may charge a fee of up to Twenty-five
Dollars ($25.00) for the two sets of fingerprints. All fees
collected by the sheriff from taking fingerprints pursuant to the
provisions of this paragraph shall be retained by the sheriff and
deposited into the Sheriff's Service Fee Account;
  9. The sheriff shall submit to the Oklahoma State Bureau of
Investigation within the fourteen-day period, together with the
completed application, including the certificate of training,
certificate of competency and qualification, exemption from training
certificate, photographs, processing fee and legible fingerprints
meeting the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation's Automated
Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) submission standards, and a
report of information deemed pertinent to an investigation of the
applicant for a handgun license. The sheriff shall make a
preliminary investigation of pertinent information about the
applicant and the court clerk shall assist the sheriff in locating
pertinent information in court records for this purpose. If no
pertinent information is found to exist either for or against the
applicant, the sheriff shall so indicate in the report;
  10. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, upon receipt of
the application and required information from the sheriff, shall
forward one full set of fingerprints of the applicant to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal history records
search. The cost of processing the fingerprints nationally shall be
paid from the processing fee collected by the Oklahoma State Bureau
of Investigation;


  11. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense
Act, or any other provisions of law, any person who has been granted
a permanent victim protective order by the court, as provided for in
the Protection from Domestic Abuse Act, may be issued a temporary
handgun license for a period not to exceed six (6) months. A
temporary handgun license may be issued if the person has
successfully passed the required weapons course, completed the
application process for the handgun license, passed the preliminary
investigation by the sheriff and court clerk, and provided the
sheriff proof of a certified permanent victim protective order and a
valid Oklahoma state photo identification card or driver license. 
The sheriff shall issue a temporary handgun license on a form
approved by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, at no cost. 
Any person who has been issued a temporary license shall carry the
temporary handgun license and a valid Oklahoma state photo
identification on his or her person at all times, and shall be
subject to all the requirements of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act
when carrying a handgun. The person may proceed with the handgun
licensing process. In the event the victim protective order is no
longer enforceable, the temporary handgun license shall cease to be
valid;
  12. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation shall make a
reasonable effort to investigate the information submitted by the
applicant and the sheriff to ascertain whether or not the issuance
of a handgun license would be in violation of the provisions of the
Oklahoma Self-Defense Act. The investigation by the Bureau of an
applicant shall include, but shall not be limited to: a statewide
criminal history records search, a national criminal history records
search, a Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint search, a
check of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System
(NICS), an Immigration Alien Query (IAQ) for non-United-States
citizens and, if applicable, an investigation of medical records or
other records or information deemed by the Bureau to be relevant to
the application.
     a. In the course of the investigation by the Bureau, it
        shall present the name of the applicant along with any
        known aliases, the address of the applicant and the
        Social Security number of the applicant to the
        Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse
        Services. The Department of Mental Health and
        Substance Abuse Services shall respond within ten (10)
        days of receiving such information to the Bureau as
        follows:
        (1) with a "Yes" answer, if the records of the
           Department indicate that the person was
           involuntarily committed to a mental institution
           in Oklahoma,


        (2) with a "No" answer, if there are no records
           indicating the name of the person as a person
           involuntarily committed to a mental institution
           in Oklahoma, or
        (3) with an "Inconclusive" answer if the records of
           the Department suggest the applicant may be a
           formerly committed person. In the case of an
           inconclusive answer, the Bureau shall ask the
           applicant whether he or she was involuntarily
           committed. If the applicant states under penalty
           of perjury that he or she has not been
           involuntarily committed, the Bureau shall
           continue processing the application for a
           license.
     b. In the course of the investigation by the Bureau, it
        shall check the name of any applicant who is twenty        eight (28) years of age or younger along with any
        known aliases, the address of the applicant and the
        Social Security number of the applicant against the
        records in the Juvenile Online Tracking System (JOLTS)
        of the Office of Juvenile Affairs. The Office of
        Juvenile Affairs shall provide the Bureau direct
        access to check the applicant against the records
        available on JOLTS:
        (1) if the Bureau finds a record on JOLTS that
           indicates the person was adjudicated a delinquent
           for an offense that would constitute a felony
           offense if committed by an adult within the last
           ten (10) years, the Bureau shall deny the
           license,
        (2) if the Bureau finds no record on JOLTS indicating
           the named person was adjudicated delinquent for
           an offense that would constitute a felony offense
           if committed by an adult within the last ten (10)
           years, the Bureau shall continue processing the
           application for a license, or
        (3) if the records suggest the applicant may have
           been adjudicated delinquent for an offense that
           would constitute a felony offense if committed by
           an adult but such record is inconclusive, the
           Bureau shall ask the applicant whether he or she
           was adjudicated a delinquent for an offense that
           would constitute a felony offense if committed by
           an adult within the last ten (10) years. If the
           applicant states under penalty of perjury that he
           or she was not adjudicated a delinquent within


           ten (10) years, the Bureau shall continue
           processing the application for a license; and
  13. If the background check set forth in paragraph 12 of this
subsection reveals no records pertaining to the applicant, the
Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation shall either issue a handgun
license or deny the application within sixty (60) days of the date
of receipt of the applicant's completed application and the required
information from the sheriff. In all other cases, the Oklahoma
State Bureau of Investigation shall either issue a handgun license
or deny the application within ninety (90) days of the date of the
receipt of the applicant's completed application and the required
information from the sheriff. The Bureau shall deny a license when
the applicant fails to properly complete the application form or
application process or, based on the background check set forth in
paragraph 12 of this subsection, is determined not to be eligible as
specified by the provisions of Section 1290.9, 1290.10 or 1290.11 of
this title. The Bureau shall approve an application in all other
cases. If an application is denied, the Bureau shall notify the
applicant in writing of its decision. The notification shall state
the grounds for the denial and inform the applicant of the right to
an appeal as may be provided by the provisions of the Administrative
Procedures Act. All notices of denial shall be mailed by firstclass mail to the address of the applicant listed in the
application. Within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of
mailing a denial of application to an applicant, the applicant shall
notify the Bureau in writing of the intent to appeal the decision of
denial or the right of the applicant to appeal shall be deemed
waived. Any administrative hearing on a denial which may be
provided shall be conducted by a hearing examiner appointed by the
Bureau. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be a final
decision appealable to a district court in accordance with the
Administrative Procedures Act. When an application is approved, the
Bureau shall issue the license and shall mail the license by firstclass mail to the address of the applicant listed in the
application.
  B. Nothing contained in any provision of the Oklahoma SelfDefense Act shall be construed to require or authorize the
registration, documentation or providing of serial numbers with
regard to any firearm. For purposes of the Oklahoma Self-Defense
Act, the sheriff may designate a person to receive, fingerprint,
photograph or otherwise process applications for handgun licenses.

§21-1290.13. Automatic listing of licenses.
            AUTOMATIC LISTING OF LICENSES
  The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation shall maintain an
automated listing of all persons issued a handgun license in this
state pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act
and all subsequent suspended or revoked licenses. Information from
the automated listing shall only be available to a law enforcement
officer or law enforcement agency upon request for law enforcement
purposes. The Bureau shall also maintain for each applicant the
original application or a copy of the original application form and
any subsequent renewal application forms together with the
photographs, fingerprints and other pertinent information on the
applicant which shall be confidential, except to law enforcement
officers or law enforcement agencies in the performance of their
duties. The Bureau may release a copy of fingerprints of a deceased
applicant maintained by the Bureau due to an application for a
handgun license pursuant to the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act. 
Provided, however, the Bureau may release a copy of fingerprints of
a deceased applicant only to an immediate family member upon written
request. Such request shall be accompanied by a payment of Fifteen
Dollars ($15.00), which shall be deposited into the OSBI Revolving
Fund. For purposes of this section, "immediate family member" shall
mean the spouse, a child by birth or adoption, a stepchild, a parent
by birth or adoption, a stepparent, a grandparent, a grandchild, a
sibling, a stepsibling or the spouse of any immediate family member. 
To facilitate the Bureau's administration of the Oklahoma SelfDefense Act, all licensees shall maintain a current mailing address
where the licensee may receive certified mail. The licensee shall
within thirty (30) days of a change of name or address inform the
Bureau of such change.

§21-1290.14. Safety and training course.
             SAFETY AND TRAINING COURSE
  A. Each applicant for a license to carry a concealed or
unconcealed handgun pursuant to the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act must
successfully complete a firearms safety and training course in this
state conducted by a registered and approved firearms instructor as
provided by the provisions of this section or from an interactive
online firearms safety and training course available electronically
via the Internet approved and certified by the Council on Law
Enforcement Education and Training. The applicant must further
demonstrate competence and qualification with an authorized pistol
to carry as a concealed or unconcealed handgun pursuant to the
provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act, except certain persons
may be exempt from such training requirement as provided by the
provisions of Section 1290.15 of this title.
  B. The Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training
(CLEET) shall establish criteria for approving firearms instructors
and interactive online firearms safety and training courses
available electronically via the Internet for purposes of training
and qualifying individuals for a handgun license pursuant to the
provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act. Prior to submitting an
application for CLEET approval as a firearms instructor, applicants
shall attend a firearms instructor school, meeting the following
minimum requirements:
  1. Firearms instructor training conducted by one of the
following entities:
     a. Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training,
     b. National Rifle Association,
     c. Oklahoma Rifle Association,
     d. federal law enforcement agencies, or
     e. other professionally recognized organizations;
  2. The course shall be at least sixteen (16) hours in length;
  3. Upon completion of the course, the applicant shall be
qualified to provide instruction on pistols; and
  4. Receive a course completion certificate.
  All firearms instructors shall be required to meet the
eligibility requirements for a handgun license as provided in
Sections 1290.9, 1290.10, and 1290.11 of this title and the
application shall be processed as provided for applicants in Section
1290.12 of this title, including the state and national criminal
history records search and fingerprint search. A firearms
instructor shall be required to pay a fee of One Hundred Dollars
($100.00) to the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training
(CLEET) each time the person makes application for CLEET approval as
a firearms instructor pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma
Self-Defense Act. The fee shall be retained by CLEET and shall be
deposited into the Firearms Instructors Revolving Fund. CLEET shall


promulgate the rules, forms and procedures necessary to implement
the approval of firearms instructors as authorized by the provisions
of this subsection. CLEET shall periodically review each approved
instructor during a training and qualification course to assure
compliance with the rules and course contents. Any violation of the
rules may result in the revocation or suspension of CLEET and
Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation approval. Unless the
approval has been revoked or suspended, a firearms instructor’s
CLEET approval shall be for a term of five (5) years. CLEET shall
be responsible for notifying all approved firearms instructors of
statutory and policy changes related to the Oklahoma Self-Defense
Act. A firearms instructor shall not be required to submit his or
her fingerprints for a fingerprint search when renewing a firearms
instructor’s CLEET approval.
  C. 1. All firearms instructors approved by CLEET to train and
qualify individuals for a handgun license shall be required to apply
for registration with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation
after receiving CLEET approval. All firearms instructors teaching
the approved course for a handgun license must display their
registration certificate during each training and qualification
course. Each approved firearms instructor shall complete a
registration form provided by the Bureau and shall have the option
to pay a registration fee of either One Hundred Dollars ($100.00)
for a five-year registration certificate or Two Hundred Dollars
($200.00) for a ten-year registration certificate to the Bureau at
the time of each application for registration, except as provided in
paragraph 2 of this subsection. Registration certificates issued by
the Bureau shall be valid for a period of five (5) years or ten (10)
years from the date of issuance. The Bureau shall issue a five-year
or ten-year handgun license to an approved firearms instructor at
the time of issuance of a registration certificate and no additional
fee shall be required or charged. The Bureau shall maintain a
current listing of all registered firearms instructors in this
state. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to eliminate
the requirement for registration and training with CLEET as provided
in subsection B of this section. Failure to register or be trained
as required shall result in a revocation or suspension of the
instructor certificate by the Bureau.
  2. Registered instructors listed in subparagraphs a and b of
this paragraph shall not be required to renew the firearms
instructor registration certificate with the Oklahoma State Bureau
of Investigation at the expiration of the registration term,
provided the instructor is not subject to any suspension or
revocation of the firearms instructor certificate. The firearms
instructor registration with the Oklahoma State Bureau of
Investigation shall automatically renew together with the handgun
license authorized in paragraph 1 of this subsection for an


additional five-year term and no additional cost or fee may be
charged for the following individuals:
     a. an active duty law enforcement officer of this state
        or any of its political subdivisions or of the federal
        government who has a valid CLEET approval as a
        firearms instructor pursuant to the Oklahoma Self        Defense Act, and
     b. a retired law enforcement officer authorized to carry
        a firearm pursuant to Section 1289.8 of this title who
        has a valid CLEET approval as a firearms instructor
        pursuant to the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act.
  D. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation shall approve
registration for a firearms instructor applicant who is in full
compliance with CLEET rules regarding firearms instructors and the
provisions of subsection B of this section, if completion of the
federal fingerprint search is the only reason for delay of
registration of that firearms instructor applicant. Upon receipt of
the federal fingerprint search information, if the Bureau receives
information which precludes the person from having a handgun
license, the Bureau shall revoke both the registration and the
handgun license previously issued to the firearms instructor.
  E. The required firearms safety and training course and the
actual demonstration of competency and qualification required of the
applicant shall be designed and conducted in such a manner that the
course can be reasonably completed by the applicant within an eighthour period. CLEET shall establish the course content and
promulgate rules, procedures and forms necessary to implement the
provisions of this subsection. For the training and qualification
course, an applicant may be charged a fee which shall be determined
by the instructor or entity that is conducting the course. The
maximum class size shall be determined by the instructor conducting
the course; provided, however, practice shooting sessions shall not
have more than ten participating students at one time. CLEET may
establish criteria for assistant instructors and any other
requirements deemed necessary to conduct a safe and effective
training and qualification course. The course content shall include
a safety inspection of the firearm to be used by the applicant in
the training course; instruction on pistol handling, safety and
storage; dynamics of ammunition and firing; methods or positions for
firing a pistol; information about the criminal provisions of the
Oklahoma law relating to firearms; the requirements of the Oklahoma
Self-Defense Act as it relates to the applicant; self-defense and
the use of appropriate force; a practice shooting session; and a
familiarization course. The firearms instructor shall refuse to
train or qualify any person when the pistol to be used or carried by
the person is either deemed unsafe or unfit for firing or is a
weapon not authorized by the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act. The course


shall provide an opportunity for the applicant to qualify himself or
herself with a pistol; provided, no pistol shall be capable of
firing larger than .45 caliber ammunition. Any applicant who
successfully trains and qualifies himself or herself with a pistol
shall be approved by the firearms instructor on the training
certificate. Upon successful completion of the training and
qualification course, a certificate of training and a certificate of
competency and qualification shall be issued to each applicant who
successfully completes the course. The certificate of training and
certificate of competency and qualification shall comply with the
forms established by CLEET and shall be submitted with an
application for a handgun license pursuant to the provisions of
paragraph 2 of subsection A of Section 1290.12 of this title. The
certificate of training and certificate of competency and
qualification issued to an applicant shall be valid for a period of
three (3) years.
  F. There is hereby created a revolving fund for the Council on
Law Enforcement Education and Training (CLEET), to be designated the
“Firearms Instructors Revolving Fund”. The fund shall be a
continuing fund, not subject to fiscal year limitations, and shall
consist of all funds received for approval of firearms instructors
for purposes of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act. All funds received
shall be deposited to the fund. All monies accruing to the credit
of the fund are hereby appropriated and may be budgeted and expended
by the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training, for
implementation of the training and qualification course contents,
approval of firearms instructors and any other CLEET requirement
pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act or as
may otherwise be deemed appropriate by CLEET. Expenditures from the
fund shall be made upon warrants issued by the State Treasurer
against claims filed as prescribed by law with the Director of the
Office of Management and Enterprise Services for approval and
payment.
  G. Firearms instructors shall keep on file for a period of not
less than three (3) years a roster of each training class, the
safety test score of each individual, the caliber and the weapon
each individual used when qualifying and whether or not each
individual successfully completed the training course. Firearms
instructors shall be authorized to destroy all training documents
and records upon expiration of the three-year time period.

§21-1290.17. Suspension and revocation of license.
          SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION OF LICENSE
  A. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation shall have
authority pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense
Act and any other provision of law to suspend or revoke any handgun
license issued pursuant to the provisions of the Oklahoma SelfDefense Act. A person whose license has been suspended or revoked
or against whom a fine has been assessed shall be entitled to an
appeal through a hearing in accordance with the Administrative
Procedures Act. Any administrative hearing on suspensions,
revocations or fines shall be conducted by a hearing examiner
appointed by the Bureau. The hearing examiner's decision shall be a
final decision appealable to a district court in accordance with the
Administrative Procedures Act. After a handgun license has been
issued, the discovery of or the occurrence of any condition which
directly affects a person's eligibility for a handgun license as
provided by the provisions of Section 1290.9 or 1290.10 of this
title shall require a revocation of the license by the Bureau. The
discovery of or the occurrence of any condition pursuant to Section
1290.11 of this title, after a license has been issued, shall cause
a suspension of the handgun license for a period of time as
prescribed for the condition. Any provision of law that requires a
revocation of a handgun license upon a conviction shall cause the
Bureau to suspend the handgun license upon the discovery of the
arrest of the person for such offense until a determination of the
criminal case at which time the Bureau shall proceed with the
appropriate administrative action. A licensee may voluntarily
surrender a license to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation at
any time. Such surrender of a handgun license will render the
license invalid. Nothing in this section may be interpreted to
prevent a subsequent new application for a license. The licensee
shall be informed and acknowledge in writing as follows:


  1. The licensee understands that the voluntary surrender of the
license will not be deemed a suspension or revocation by the Bureau;
  2. A voluntary surrender of a license will not be reviewable by
a hearing examiner or subject to judicial review under the
Administrative Procedures Act; and
  3. By surrendering the license, the licensee shall forfeit all
fees paid to date.
  B. Any handgun license which is subsequently suspended or
revoked shall be immediately returned to the Oklahoma State Bureau
of Investigation upon notification. Any person refusing or failing
to return a license after notification of its suspension or
revocation shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor
punishable by a fine of not exceeding Five Hundred Dollars
($500.00), by imprisonment in the county jail for not exceeding six
(6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. In addition, the
person shall be subject to an administrative fine of Five Hundred
Dollars ($500.00), upon a hearing and determination by the Bureau
that the person is in violation of the provisions of this
subsection.
  C. Any law enforcement officer of this state shall confiscate a
handgun license in the possession of any person and return it to the
Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation for appropriate
administrative proceedings against the licensee when the license is
no longer needed as evidence in any criminal proceeding, as follows:
  1. Upon the arrest of the person for any felony offense;
  2. Upon the arrest of the person for any misdemeanor offense
enumerated as a preclusion to a handgun license;
  3. For any violation of the provisions of the Oklahoma SelfDefense Act;
  4. When the officer has been called to assist or is
investigating any situation which would be a preclusion to having a
handgun license; or
  5. As provided in subsection D of Section 1290.8 of this title.
  D. Any administrative fine assessed in accordance with the
provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act shall be paid in full
within thirty (30) days of assessment. The Oklahoma State Bureau of
Investigation shall, without a hearing, suspend the handgun license
of any person who fails to pay in full any administrative fine
assessed against the person in accordance with the provisions of
this subsection. The suspension of any handgun license shall be
automatic and shall begin thirty (30) days from the date of the
assessment of the administrative fine. The suspension shall be
removed and the handgun license returned to its prior standing upon
payment of the administrative fine being paid in full to the Bureau.
  E. Whenever a handgun license has been suspended in accordance
with the provisions of this act or the administrative rules of the


Bureau promulgated for purposes of this act, the license shall
remain under suspension and shall not be reinstated until:
  1. The person whose license has been suspended applies for
reinstatement in accordance with the administrative rules of the
Bureau. The Bureau shall not charge any fee in conjunction with an
application for a license reinstatement. The person whose license
has been suspended must demonstrate that the condition or preclusion
which was the basis for the suspension has lapsed and is no longer
in effect; and
  2. Any and all administrative fines assessed against the person
have been paid in full.
  In the event a handgun license expires during the term of the
suspension, the person shall be required to apply for renewal of the
license in accordance with Section 1290.5 of this title.

manner the existing rights of any person, property owner, tenant,
employer, liquor store, place of worship or business entity to
control the possession of weapons on any property owned or
controlled by the person or business entity.

prohibiting any person, except a convicted felon, from transporting
and storing firearms in a locked vehicle on any property set aside
for any vehicle.
  C. A property owner, tenant, employer, liquor store, place of
worship or business entity may prohibit any person from carrying a
concealed or unconcealed firearm on the property. If the building
or property is open to the public, the property owner, tenant,
employer, liquor store, place of worship or business entity shall
post signs on or about the property stating such prohibition.
  D. No person, property owner, tenant, employer, liquor store,
holder of an event permit, place of worship or business entity shall

firearm on property within the specific exclusion provided for in
paragraph 4 of subsection B of Section 1277 of this title; provided
that carrying a concealed or unconcealed firearm may be prohibited

business entity owns, or has legal control of, is immune from any
liability arising from that decision. Except for acts of gross
negligence or willful or wanton misconduct, an employer who does or
does not prohibit his or her employees from carrying a concealed or
unconcealed weapon is immune from any liability arising from that
decision. A person, property owner, tenant, employer, liquor store,

an employer, employee or person who has suffered loss resulting from
the discharge of a weapon to seek redress or damages of the person
who discharged the weapon or used the weapon outside the provisions
of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act.

§21-1290.25. Legislative intent.
                 LEGISLATIVE INTENT
  The Legislature finds as a matter of public policy and fact that
it is necessary to provide statewide uniform standards for carrying
concealed or unconcealed firearms for lawful self-defense and selfprotection, and further finds it necessary to occupy the field of
regulation of the bearing of concealed or unconcealed firearms to
ensure that no honest, law-abiding citizen who qualifies pursuant to
the provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act is subjectively or
arbitrarily denied his or her rights. The Legislature does not
delegate to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation any authority
to regulate or restrict the issuing of handgun licenses except as
provided by the provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act. 
Subjective or arbitrary actions or rules which encumber the issuing
process by placing burdens on the applicant beyond those
requirements detailed in the provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense
Act or which create restrictions beyond those specified in the
Oklahoma Self-Defense Act are deemed to be in conflict with the
intent of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act and are hereby prohibited. 
The Oklahoma Self-Defense Act shall be liberally construed to carry
out the constitutional right to bear arms for self-defense and selfprotection. The provisions of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act are
cumulative to existing rights to bear arms and nothing in the
Oklahoma Self-Defense Act shall impair or diminish those rights.
  However, the conditions that mandate the administrative actions
of license denial, suspension, revocation or an administrative fine
are intended to protect the health, safety and public welfare of the
citizens of this state. The restricting conditions specified in the
Oklahoma Self-Defense Act generally involve the criminal history,
mental state, alcohol or substance abuse of the applicant or
licensee, a hazard of domestic violence, a danger to police


officers, or the ability of the Oklahoma State Bureau of
Investigation to properly administer the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act. 
The restricting conditions that establish a risk of injury or harm
to the public are tailored to reduce the risks to the benefit of the
citizens of this state.

§21-1290.26. Reciprocal agreement authority.
             RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT AUTHORITY
  A. The State of Oklahoma shall hereby recognize any valid
concealed or unconcealed carry weapons permit, valid military
identification card as provided for qualified persons in Section
1290.8 of this title or license issued by another state, or if the

  9. Where the property is possessed or controlled by virtue of a
lease or rental agreement, and the property is willfully or

Hundred Dollars ($500.00), any person convicted shall be punished by

party so convicted and sentenced, and shall be enforced by execution
or other process for the use of the person whose money or other
funds or property were embezzled. In all cases the fine, so
operating as a judgment lien, shall be released or entered as
satisfied only by the person in interest.

person benefiting from, acting in a fiduciary capacity for, or
otherwise administering a probate, intestate, or trust estate,

be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court for the

and parties in interest.

  1. Upon each owner or party in interest whose right, title, or
interest is of record in the Oklahoma Tax Commission or with the
county clerk for filings under the Uniform Commercial Code, served
in the manner of service of process in civil cases prescribed by
Section 2004 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes;

are believed to have an interest in the property by one publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the
seizure was made.
  F. Within sixty (60) days after the mailing or publication of
the notice, the owner of the property and any other party in
interest or claimant may file a verified answer and claim to the
property described in the notice of seizure and of the intended
forfeiture proceeding.
  G. If at the end of sixty (60) days after the notice has been
mailed or published there is no verified answer on file, the court

the property forfeited to the state, if such fact is proven.

property may prove the lien, mortgage, or conditional sales contract
to be bona fide and that the right, title, or interest created by
the document was created without any knowledge or reason to believe
that the property was being, or was to be, used for the purpose
charged.
  K. In the event of such proof, the court may order the property
released to the bona fide or innocent owner, lien holder, mortgagee,
or vendor if the amount due such person is equal to, or in excess
of, the value of the property as of the date of the seizure, it
being the intention of this section to forfeit only the right,
title, or interest of the purchaser, except for items bearing a
counterfeit mark or used exclusively to manufacture a counterfeit
mark.

not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the
petitioner or in the custody of the law enforcement agency as


provided in the Trademark Anti-Counterfeiting Act. Except for
property required to be destroyed pursuant to the Trademark AntiCounterfeiting Act, the petitioner shall release said property to
the owner of the property if it is determined that the owner had no
knowledge of the illegal use of the property or if there is
insufficient evidence to sustain the burden of showing illegal use
of such property. If the owner of the property stipulates to the
forfeiture and waives the hearing, the petitioner may determine if
the value of the property is equal to or less than the outstanding
lien. If such lien exceeds the value of the property, the property
may be released to the lien holder. Property which has not been
released by the petitioner shall be subject to the orders and
decrees of the court or the official having jurisdiction thereof.
  N. The petitioner, or the law enforcement agency holding
property pursuant to the Trademark Anti-Counterfeiting Act, shall

vendor, or mortgagee of the property, if any, up to the amount of
such person's interest in the property, when the court declaring the
forfeiture orders a distribution to such person;
  2. To the payment of the actual reasonable expenses of
preserving the property;
  3. To the victim of the crime to compensate said victim for any

section. This subsection does not apply to any transaction between
an individual and the counsel of the individual necessary to
preserve the right to representation of the individual, as

  A. Any commissioned peace officer of this state is authorized
to seize any currency, negotiable instrument, monetary instrument,
equipment or property used or involved in, used to facilitate,
delivered from or traceable to a violation of Section 2001 of this
title. The seized item may be held as evidence until a forfeiture
has been declared or a release ordered. Forfeiture actions under
this section may be brought by the district attorney or Attorney
General in the proper county of venue as petitioner; provided, in
the event the district attorney or Attorney General elects not to
file such action, or fails to file such action within ninety (90)
days of the date of the seizure of the item, the item shall be
returned to the owner.
  B. Notice of seizure and intended forfeiture proceeding shall
be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court for the
county wherein the item is seized and shall be given all owners and
parties in interest.
  C. Notice shall be given according to one of the following
methods:
  1. Upon each owner, lienholder, or party in interest whose name
and address is known, served in the manner of service of process in
civil cases prescribed by Section 2004 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma
Statutes; or
  2. Upon all other owners, whose addresses are unknown, but who
are believed to have an interest in the property by one publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the
seizure was made.
  D. Within sixty (60) days after the mailing or publication of
the notice, the owner of the property and any other party in
interest or claimant may file a verified answer and claim to the
item described in the notice of seizure and of the intended
forfeiture proceeding.
  E. If at the end of sixty (60) days after the notice has been
mailed or published there is no verified answer on file, the court
shall hear evidence upon the fact of the unlawful use and may order
the item forfeited to the state, if such fact is proven.
  F. If a verified answer is filed, the forfeiture proceeding
shall be set for hearing.
  G. Proceedings under this section shall be special proceedings.
  H. At the hearing the petitioner shall prove by a preponderance
of the evidence that property was used in the attempt or commission
of an act specified in subsection A of this section with knowledge
by the owner of the item.
  I. The claimant of any right, title, or interest in the item
may prove the lien, mortgage, or conditional sales contract to be
bona fide and that the right, title, or interest created by the item


was created without any knowledge or reason to believe that the item
was being, or was to be, used for the purpose charged.
  J. In the event of such proof, the court may order the item
released to the bona fide or innocent owner, lienholder, mortgagee,
or vendor if the amount due such person is equal to, or in excess
of, the value of the item as of the date of the seizure, it being
the intention of this section to forfeit only the right, title, or
interest of the purchaser.
  K. If the amount due to such person is less than the value of
the item, or if no bona fide claim is established, the item may be
forfeited to the state and may be sold pursuant to judgment of the
court, as on sale upon execution, and as provided in Section 2-508
of Title 63 of the Oklahoma Statutes, except as otherwise provided
for by law.
  L. A seized item taken or detained pursuant to this section
shall not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody
of the petitioner or in the custody of the law enforcement agency. 
The petitioner shall release the seized item to the owner of the
item if it is determined that the owner had no knowledge of the
illegal use of the item or if there is insufficient evidence to
sustain the burden of showing illegal use of the item. If the owner
of the property stipulates to the forfeiture and waives the hearing,
the petitioner may determine if the value of the item is equal to or
less than the outstanding lien. If such lien exceeds the value of
the item, the item may be released to the lienholder. A seized item
which has not been released by the petitioner shall be subject to
the orders and decrees of the court or the official having
jurisdiction thereof.
  M. Attorney fees shall not be assessed against the state or the
petitioner for any actions or proceeding pursuant to this section.
  N. The proceeds of the sale of any property shall be
distributed as follows, in the order indicated:
  1. To the bona fide or innocent purchaser, conditional sales
vendor, or mortgagee of the item, if any, up to the amount of the
interest of that person in the property, when the court declaring
the forfeiture orders a distribution to such person;
  2. To the payment of the actual reasonable expenses of
preserving the item;
  3. To the victim of the crime to compensate the victim for any
loss incurred as a result of the act for which the item was
forfeited; and
  4. The balance to a revolving fund in the office of the county
treasurer of the county wherein the property was seized, to be
distributed as follows: one-half (1/2) to the investigating law
enforcement agency and one-half (1/2) to the district attorney to be
used to defray any lawful expenses of the office of the district
attorney. If the petitioner is not the district attorney, then the


one-half (1/2) which would have been designated to that office shall
be distributed to the petitioner.
  O. If the court finds that the item was not used in the attempt
or commission of an act specified in subsection A of this section
and was not an item subject to forfeiture pursuant to subsection B
of this section, the court shall order the item released to the
owner as the right, title, or interest as determined by the court.
  P. No vehicle, airplane, or vessel used by a person as a common
carrier in the transaction of business as a common carrier shall be
forfeited pursuant to the provisions of this section unless it shall
be proven that the owner or other person in charge of such
conveyance was a consenting party or privy to the attempt or
commission of an act specified in subsection A or B of this section. 
No item shall be forfeited pursuant to the provisions of this
section by reason of any act or omission established by the owner
thereof to have been committed or omitted without the knowledge or
consent of such owner, and by any person other than such owner while
the item was unlawfully in the possession of a person other than the
owner in violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of
any state.
  Q. Whenever any item is forfeited pursuant to this section, the
district court having jurisdiction of the proceeding may order that
the forfeited item may be retained for its official use by the
state, county, or municipal law enforcement agency which seized the
item.
